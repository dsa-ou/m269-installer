To install the M269 software, you need about 1 Gb of disk space and
a modern operating system: Linux, macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later, Windows 10 or 11.
**Note**: In these instructions, Unix refers to Linux or macOS.

You can have your M269 book and TMAs in a cloud folder, but you must
install Python 3.11 and the M269 software on each computer you use.

If you need help with the following instructions, ask in the M269 Technical Forum.

## 1 Preparation

Before installing the M269 software, do the following:

1. Create your M269 folder, which is where you put the M269 book and TMAs.
   The folder must be named `m269-24j` or `M269-24J` and
   can be anywhere on your disk, including a cloud drive.
   (You probably already did this step before you downloaded the M269 book.)
   <!-- The following avoids unreadable notebook error. -->
   If you're using Windows 10 and your M269 folder is on OneDrive,
   then right-click your M269 folder and choose 'always keep on this device'.

2. Check if you have Python 3.11:
   - Windows: open a PowerShell, enter `py -0` and see if 3.11 is listed
   - Unix: open a terminal and enter `python3.11 -V`

   If 3.11 isn't listed or you get an error message like `command not found`,
   then go to the next step, otherwise go directly to step 4 (macOS) or 5 (Windows and Linux).

3. Install Python 3.11, even if you have a newer version.
   Do *not* uninstall any Python version you have.
   - Windows: Follow [these instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-version-of-windows-operating-system-am-i-running-628bec99-476a-2c13-5296-9dd081cdd808)
     to check if you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows. Then download and run the
     [32-bit installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9.exe) or the
     [64-bit installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-amd64.exe).
     After installing, disable the pathname limit if you're given that option.
   - macOS: download and run the [installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-macos11.pkg)
   - Linux: enter `sudo apt install python3.11` or similar (search online for instructions for your Linux distribution).
     If you're using a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, you must additionally
     enter `sudo apt install python3.11-venv` or similar.

4. macOS only: open a terminal, enter `xcode-select --install` and follow the instructions.
   If you get a message that the command line tools are already installed,
   then this step is completed.

5. Close any PowerShell (Windows) or terminal (Unix) you have opened.

## 2 Installation

To avoid errors, we suggest that instead of typing the commands,
you select and copy them from this page and paste them into the command line.

1. Open a PowerShell (Windows) or a terminal (Unix).

2. Go to your M269 folder by entering `cd <M269 folder path>`, e.g. `cd ~/OU/m269-24j`.
   (In PowerShell and Unix, `~` is a shorthand for your home folder.)

3. Download the installation script:
   - Windows: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsa-ou/m269-installer/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1`
   - Unix: `curl -LO https://github.com/dsa-ou/m269-installer/raw/main/install.sh`

4. Allow the installation script to run:
   - Windows: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser`
              and then select the `Y` (yes) option if you're given a choice
   - Unix: `chmod +x install.sh`

5. Run the installation script:
   - Windows: `.\install.ps1`
   - Unix: `./install.sh`

   On Unix, ignore a message about pytype and networkx being incompatible.

6. Close the terminal.

You will have the following files in your M269 folder:
- the installation script in `install.ps1` (Windows) or `install.sh` (Unix)
- the list of M269 software in `requirements.txt`
- the style changes to Jupyter notebooks in `custom.css`

We recommend you do _not_ remove these files, so that you can re-install
the software, if needed.

## 3 Usage

To work on the M269 notebooks, follow these steps.
You can press Tab to complete commands and pathnames.

1. Open a new PowerShell (Windows) or a new terminal (Unix).

2. Enter `m269-24j` to go to your M269 folder and activate the M269 software.
   The command line prompt becomes `(m269-24j) ...` to remind you that
   you're using the M269 software and not your default Python installation.

   **Important:** Never install software while the M269 software is active,
   as that may change the M269 software installation and break it.

3. Enter `nb` to start working with notebooks.
   After a little while, a web browser opens, with JupyterLab,
   listing the contents of your M269 folder.
   (You can now continue reading Section 1.3 of the book.)

4. After finishing working on the notebooks, select 'Shut down'
   from JupyterLab's File menu, then close the browser tab.

5. Close the PowerShell (Windows) or terminal (Unix).

**Note for macOS users**:
If steps 2 and 3 (the `m269-24j` and `nb` commands) are not working,
and you are using `bash`, enter in the terminal
 ```bash
 echo 'if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then source ~/.bashrc; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
 ```
Then close your terminal, open a new one, and try again steps 2 and 3.

## 4 Uninstalling

At the end of the M269 24J presentation, if you wish to remove the M269 software,
delete folder `~/venvs/m269-24j`.
If you also want to remove the `m269-24j` and `nb` commands:

1. Find out in which file they are defined.
   - Windows: open a PowerShell and enter `$Profile.CurrentUserCurrentHost` to obtain the file name
   - Unix: open a terminal and enter `echo $0` to obtain the shell you're using.
     If it's fish, then the commands are in file `~/.config/fish/config.fish`,
     otherwise they're in file `~/.shellrc`, where `shell` is the name of your shell.
     For example, if you're using bash, then it's file `~/.bashrc`.

2. Open the file in a text editor.

3. Search for the lines that define the `m269-24j` and `nb`
   functions (Windows) or aliases (Unix). Delete those lines.

4. Save the file and close the text editor.

If you want to remove the M269 styling of notebooks:

1. Open file `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css` in a text editor.

2. Delete all lines from `/* Start of M269-24J ... */` to `/* End of M269-24J ... */`.

3. Save the file and close the editor.

## 5 Re-installing

If you haven't removed the installation files from your M269 folder,
you can re-install the software after uninstalling it,
e.g. to work again on your M269 notebooks. Do as follows:

1. Open a PowerShell (Windows) or a terminal (Unix).

2. Go to your M269 folder by entering `cd <M269 folder path>`, e.g. `cd ~/OU/m269-24j`.

3. Run the installation script with `.\install.ps1 .` (Windows) or `./install.sh .` (Unix).
   Note the extra space and period after the command, compared to step 5 in Section 2.
   (During re-installation, ignore messages about the usage of the `cp` command or
   about a file being copied onto itself.)

4. Close the terminal.
