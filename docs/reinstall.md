## Re-installing

If you haven't removed the installation files from your M269 folder,
you can re-install the software, even after [uninstalling](uninstall.md) it.

1. Open a new PowerShell (Windows) or terminal (Linux and macOS).
   Do _not_ use an already opened PowerShell or terminal.

2. Enter `cd <M269 folder path>`, e.g. `cd ~/OU/m269-24j`, to go to your M269 folder.

3. Enter `.\install.ps1 .` (Windows) or `./install.sh .` (Linux, macOS) to
   run the installation script. Note the space and period after the command.

4. Close the PowerShell or terminal.
